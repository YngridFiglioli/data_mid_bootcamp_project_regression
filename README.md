# data_mid_bootcamp_project_regression

This is a group project from the Data Analytics Ironhack bootcamp. 
The goal is to build a model that will predict the price of a house based on features provided in the dataset.
To do so, we had several requirements to fullfil in Python, MySQL and Tableau, also finishing it with a business oriented presentention.

The group is formed of 03 tech women: Ela, Laura and myself. 
We divided the work, but everyone came toghether to solve problems, bugs, to bild a strong presentation and of course, the code, queries and visuals have a hint from all three of us.
